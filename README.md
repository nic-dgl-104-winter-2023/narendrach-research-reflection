# Narendra's Research and Reflection Journal
This is my research and reflection journal for DGL 104 winter 2023


# course goals

- Learning javascript in class and java languages simultaniously to helps in the future.
- Spending 5 to 6 hours on weekends to getting know better in the language.
- In time work completion and submission.
- Want to create some new things with learned technology or skill.
- Want to use this in an organization i am going to work and get better in using those new technology.
- Perfect in what i am learning in this course.
- Learned java script along with lectures and done my own research where i am feeling difficult and applied those problems again in the code and solved by own.
- Through Community code works i am practicing java and writing some codes for issues and finding solutions to issues.


## interests

- *Get* a nice job and make satisfied with my job.
- Up to date with the new technologies.
- I want to learn HTML, CSS and scripting languages for my  future goal, where these are source to make a website and run's in a effective manner.
- Want to develop one site for my village and local area about things in the places.
- 

## Come up

- Develop web app or mobile app for my region on places. It helps in outer people know about particular place.
- Work through the knowledge you have keep track on it.
- Make sure to revise what you know and what has to do.
- I am working on my programming skills and language where it helps me in the project  and some other courses, by spending some time on the outcomes of this course.
- By using javascript i have added some *onclick()* method calling alerts to my page in project and done some dynamic changes to the pages in the site. 
- Created some notification alerts for user informative alerts by spending some time across browsing things that i need.


# Reflection of Style guide

- The majority of class and interface names start with a capital letter and are nouns or noun phrases.
- Most method names start with a lowercase letter. A procedure name is typically a verb phrase that is a command to do something since a call on a process is a statement to do something.

- ```void setTitle() public```
Lowercase letters are typically used to begin variable names.
- The reader should be given suggestions in the variable names as to what they are utilized for. A well-documented program is simpler to understand and benefits from names that hint at the variable's meaning. 
- On the other side, calling your variable names after your friends or your favourite flowers and complicates the application. Avoid doing that. Additionally, avoid giving variables ambiguous names like counter, var, or data; instead, consider what the variable will actually be used for and give it a more specific name.

## Programming Practice Article 

- Testing is the topic our group selected to do in the assignment that we have to write for it.

- How to do unit testing by Sergey. K [Unit Testing and Coding: Best Practice for Unit testing | Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/qa/how-to-write-testable-code-and-why-it-matters#:~:text=A%20typical%20unit%20test%20contains,it%20observes%20the%20resulting%20behavior).
- In sergey explination, he thought about what it is and how we are using it and what are the benifits that we can achive by this unit testing.

- Unit Testing tutorial [Unit Testing Tutorial - What is, Types and Test Examples](https://www.guru99.com/unit-testing-guide.html).
- In this article there are couple of videos along with text that explains from what to when and where.these techniquies are using and uses.

- What is unit testing and how do you do it? [What is Unit Testing How do you Do it?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/652292/what-is-unit-testing-and-how-do-you-do-it).
- In Stack overflow, there are small code snippets and testing examples and more over different people explination in their view which we can get more knowlwdge while we are searching for them.

- [Software testing methods like unit testing are essential for assuring the dependability and quality of a program. Early bug detection and correction can save time and money in the long run because it is a cost-effective method.](https://circleci.com/enterprise/)
- The ability to independently test particular pieces of code rather than having to test the complete application is one of the main advantages of unit testing.[How to do unit testing by Sergey. K](https://www.toptal.com/qa/how-to-write-testable-code-and-why-it-matters)
- This improves in spotting issues early on in the development process, before they escalate in complexity and cost to resolve. Unit tests also offer a safety net for upcoming code revisions, making it simpler to make sure that changes to one section of the code do not unintentionally break another.[Unit Testing Best Practices with .NET Core and .NET Standard.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-best-practices)
- Additionally, unit testing encourages a more flexible and reusable code architecture. Developers are compelled to consider the different parts of their code in isolation and how they interact with one another when they design unit tests. As a result, the codebase is better planned and easier to maintain.[Why is unit Testing is important for developers.](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/answer/Is-unit-testing-an-important-aspect-of-software-development)

## Short reflection of Research and Reflection repository.
- Coming to this repository what i observed is i can monitor the things i have written in this journal and also can question us that what we have done and what i have to focus in the fututre to achive future goals by spending enough time on particular tasks.

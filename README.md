# Reflection of Style guide

- Class and interface names are generally noun or noun phrases and begin with a capital letter:

- Method names generally begin with a lowercase letter. A call on a procedure is a statement to do something, so a procedure name is generally a verb phrase that is a command to do something.
  public void setTitle(String t) { ... }
- Variable names generally start with a lowercase letter.
- Variable names should give the reader some hint about what the variable is used for. A well-chosen name, which gives a hint at the meaning of the variable, helps document a program, making it easier to understand. On the other hand, using the names of your friends or flowers that you like as variable names just annoys and makes the program harder to understand. Don't do that. Also, refrain from using vague names like counter or var or data; instead think about what the variable really is for and use a more concrete name.

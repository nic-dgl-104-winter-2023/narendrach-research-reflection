# Reflection of Style guide

- The majority of class and interface names start with a capital letter and are nouns or noun phrases.


- Most method names start with a lowercase letter. A procedure name is typically a verb phrase that is a command to do something since a call on a process is a statement to do something.
void setTitle() public
Lowercase letters are typically used to begin variable names.
- The reader should be given suggestions in the variable names as to what they are utilized for. A well-documented program is simpler to understand and benefits from names that hint at the variable's meaning. 
- On the other side, calling your variable names after your friends or your favourite flowers and complicates the application. Avoid doing that. Additionally, avoid giving variables ambiguous names like counter, var, or data; instead, consider what the variable will actually be used for and give it a more specific name.
